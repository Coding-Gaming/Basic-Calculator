# Calculator Project
=======================

A simple calculator project that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project also includes a color picker feature that allows users to change the primary color of the calculator.

## Features
------------

* Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Color picker feature to change the primary color of the calculator
* CSS variables used to manage colors and styles

## Getting Started
-------------------

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to use the calculator
3. Use the color picker input element to change the primary color of the calculator

## Code Structure
-----------------

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the calculator UI and color picker
* `styles.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and colors for the calculator
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the calculator and color picker

## Calculator Logic
-------------------

The calculator logic is implemented in the `script.js` file. It uses CSS variables to manage the colors and styles of the calculator. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Color Picker
----------------

The color picker feature is implemented using an HTML input element with the `type` attribute set to `"color"`. The JavaScript code listens for changes to the input value and updates the primary color of the calculator using CSS variables.
